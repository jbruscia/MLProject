HOW TO RUN:

To run our project for the first time, enter the Menu directory and run the 
compile script. This will compile all the libraries for the data wrapper and 4 
different machine learning algorithms and then execute. Later, if you would like 
to run again, there is an executable named menu that can be ran. 

INSTRUCTIONS:

There are four options in the main menu.

1) Test
	
        This pulls up all the data sets that you can test the 4 different algorithms. When you choose a dataset, it will run it each algorithm on it and display 
	the time it took to run and the success rate. After, you can either re-run, do a new test or return to the main menu.
	
2) Learn more about the algorithms
	
        Here, you can choose any of the four algorithms and it will display information about the algorithm. After, you may choose another algorithm or return to the main menu.
	
3) Learn more about the datasets
	
        With this option, you can learn more about individual datasets. After, you 
	may choose another dataset or return to the main menu.
	
4) Quit
	
        The program will stop.

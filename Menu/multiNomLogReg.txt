Multinomial Logistic Regression

Description

Multinomial Logistic Regression is, in itself, a mathematical technique for classifying data to certain classifiers by modeling the relationship as a dot product of the dependent variables with certaining weights that are calculated via ordinary linear regression. This dot product comprises a predictor function that takes in a new data points dependent variables and outputs a value that lies within the range of classifier values (numbers that correspond to the string classifier of a datapoint). It essentially creates multiple gradients that separate the differnt class fields of data and can guess which classifier a new data point would fall under based on which gradient this data point lies within. \n"

Strengths
   *Extremely fast due to mathematical nature
   *Works very well with binarily classified data (data with only two classifiers)

Weaknesses
   *Inconsistent on small sample sizes and on data with more than four classifiers
   *Inner workings are numerical weights which aren't the most intelligible to humans
